AND SEARCHES
AND searches require that all of the terms you have listed are found in your results. AND narrows or decreases results.
The result would be everything in the green area: the solutions that contain both blue and yellow.
For example: design and html — The results would be everyone who had “design” as well as “html” listed somewhere in
their resume.

AND
Boolean 101. Here’s your quick guide to understanding the basics of Boolean.

OR SEARCHES
OR searches require that your results contain any one of the terms being searched. The OR operator can be used to
broaden or increase your results.
In this case, the result would be everything in the blue, yellow, or green area: the solutions that are either blue or yellow!
For example: mechanic or diesel — The results would be everyone who had either “mechanic” or “diesel” listed
somewhere in their resume.

OR

NOT SEARCHES
NOT (or AND NOT) Searches — NOT (or AND NOT) searches mean that a term or terms can be excluded from your results.
In this case, the result would be everything in the blue area only — nothing that contains any yellow!
For example: pharmaceutical and not sales
The results would be everyone who had “pharmaceutical” in their resume, but would automatically exclude everyone
who had “sales.”
